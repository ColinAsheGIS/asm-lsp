# look-asm

## Goal

Lookup an assembly instruction code from your terminal.

% TODO - Add example usage

This tool can serve as a reference point when reading the assembly output of a
program. This way you can deliberate about whether the compiler is producing the
desired output or whether you have to tweak your code for optimisation.
